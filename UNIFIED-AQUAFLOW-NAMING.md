# 📱 ALL APPS NAMED "AQUAFLOW" - FINAL UPDATE

## 🎯 PERFECT LOGIC!

**Your reasoning:** 
- **You** (using all 3 apps) → Distinguish by **ICON COLORS/DESIGNS**
- **Other users** (using only 1 app) → See clean **"AquaFlow"** brand

**Smart decision!** ✨

## ✅ WHAT I UPDATED

Changed all 3 manifests to show **"AquaFlow"** under the icon:

### **Customer App (manifest-customer.json):**
```json
"name": "AquaFlow",
"short_name": "AquaFlow"
```

### **Owner App (manifest-owner.json):**
```json
"name": "AquaFlow",
"short_name": "AquaFlow"
```

### **Driver App (manifest-driver.json):**
```json
"name": "AquaFlow",
"short_name": "AquaFlow"
```

## 📱 HOME SCREEN RESULT

### **Your Phone (All 3 Apps Installed):**
```
💧              📊              🚚
AquaFlow       AquaFlow       AquaFlow
(Blue)         (Purple)       (Green)
```

**Easy to distinguish by:**
- ✅ Icon color (Blue/Purple/Green)
- ✅ Icon design (3 people / chart+₱ / pin)

### **Customer's Phone (Only 1 App):**
```
💧
AquaFlow
(Blue)
```

**Clean, professional, unified brand!** ✨

AquaFlow
(Green)
```

## 🔄 CACHE BUSTING UPDATED

Changed all install pages from `?v=2` to `?v=3`:

- ✅ install-customer.html → `?v=3`
- ✅ install-owner.html → `?v=3`
- ✅ install-driver.html → `?v=3`

Forces browser to reload with new app names!
