Me: What is your daily challenge in running the water refilling business?

Jennifer Answer: Challenge is the monitoring, (I think she mean monitoring about everything in the business), Container issues and damages, a customer will say to the delivery boy "you will get back for the payment because i don't have  change my money is a thousand bill" until we missed to get the payment and it happens many times, i think the online payment will solve that problem because we will not deliver to them if there is no received payment unless it is COD. 

Me: What did you use on keeping records or what is your current system on managing your business?

Jennifer Answer: We do it manually, We use record book only. Sometimes if the casher was not able to go to work. I will review the cctv just to get the right data.

Me: For your existing customers, in what way or how they will order water?


Jennifer Answer: There are customer that is scheduled for us to deliver the water, some will call us, Some chat us thru messenger, and some customer will wait for us to go to their place and we will ask them if they still have water or they run out of water. sometime very other day we will check random customer if they still have or run out. They will expect our checking from time to time but if we cannot manage on checking them that's the time they will call us.

Me: How many personnel you had to run your business?

Jennifer Answer: i have four personnel, 1 in casher, 2 in delivery and 1 in refilling. 

Me: Did you have a minimum order.?

Jennifer Answer: it depends, in downtown we don't required minimum order. but in country side or out of town we required and it depend on how many kilometers to the delivery location.

Me: What is your challenge in swapping method?

Jennifer Answer: sometimes there are arguing because of like i said the damages and issues of container.

Me: Which is the majority of your customer? about who adopt the swapping and who don't adopt the swapping?

Jennifer Answer: The customer who adopt the swapping is the one who is reseller, and the household, The companies wont adopt swapping because they have their own container with marker on it.

Me: can you enumerate all the challenges and problems in running your business using your current system? and what the app can help if we will use it to replace your current system?

Jennifer Answer: 
-For Payment! example the customer pay us partially because they reason they will follow up for the full payment. we have nothing to do but to consider them because if we will take back the delivered water it cost us energy, effort and gas. If its transacted within the App we are safe because we only deliver to the paid transaction. 

-For Costumer Monitoring! We don't know in real time if our customer is still have water or they ran out of water. like i said we need to go to them to ask for their water status. If there is an app all we have to do is to accept their order and no more monitoring involve. I think that is really a big help for us.

-For Sales, Inventory and Revenue! We are planning to acquire a POS but until now we don't have it for some reason. We are struggling to track our inventory weekly, Monthly and Yearly. We rely on our record books. Which i think there are transactions or orders we've missed to record and other expenses not monitored. that is another problem in our business. if there is an APP which can record everything in our business and we check the data anytime we want, i think it can help us realize how much we loss and how much we gain.

-For customer's feedback! We want to serve our customer really well but we cant hear right feedback from our customer, how we serve them, how our delivery personnel handle the transaction, is it on time or there is a delay in deliveries. we here only from our delivery personnel which is we are not sure if he's telling what really customer say or they just cover up for their self. If there is an App I think we can here them in real time and we can get their concerns right away. and also we can have transparency from our personnel and then we will know how we can serve them better.

-For delivery route! sometimes we give our driver a complete instruction which is the priority in route so that we can save time and fuel consumption. but the driver frequently use their own route and sometime they completely didn't get the instruction. If that app can integrate map it would be better because the driver can visualize which route is going to take so that we can save time and transport expenses and they don't need to bring list of delivery location or need to memorize the route but the app will handle all of it to prevent the escalation before.

-For Other Expenditures! Sometimes we know that we spend for specific expenses like delivery vehicle repair or something that we really need to spend so that our business will continue running. when time for inventory or evaluation of expenditures. we missed to record it and we don't know how much we spend for that specific expenses. if expenditures is part in the app that would be great! I think we can monitor the health of our business better that the current system we use.

-For my personnel who is involve in running the business! I am planning to change their earnings, they are now in salary/day basis. sometimes there are slow days in water orders and i realize that  what the water refilling station on that day is not enough to pay the personnel on their daily basis. I am filling out on that day. i don't know how it works, how to re structure if I'm going to change the earning of the personnel. I just tell you that, that is one of my challenges. I hope you can help out.
